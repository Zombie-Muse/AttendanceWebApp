# Welcome to version 2 of the Here! Attendance app

* _update 8/25/21:_ I decided to edit the README file to show progress and explain things about the app. I've been working off and on with this in the past few weeks, and this is the first update I managed to write. I have the auth figured out and working. Users are able to create an account, log in, log out, and reset password. Once logged in, the user is able to see and use the links to navigate between pages. I'm focusing on displaying the data in an effective manner. This is my first time using a NoSQL database, so it's a bit weird for my SQL brain. My next step would be to design the Attendance page and make it functional before moving onto the other requirements. 

The previous version was developed for Android due to the requirements for my mobile applications class. This one goes further and is more accessible due to it being strictly a web app. I'm using Firebase Auth and Firestore for all the database and auth stuff, and I'm using React for the front-end. 

So far, this app is ugly. I'm designing as I go, which in retrostect, was not the best decision. Regardless, it's a work in progress. See the updates above for an idea of what's changing and my process of figuring things out.
